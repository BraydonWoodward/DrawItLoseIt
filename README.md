1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
   -The Gaming Room, has an android based game that they would like to expand. They would like it to be a web-based application so it can be played on multiple platforms.
   
2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
   -I did well at outlining the software requirements needed to meet the clients request in a concise and comprehensive manner, making it easy to read and understand.

3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
   -Working through the design document made me understand the architecture of the software. It also helped make the connection between the code and the Gaming Room's requirements.

4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
   -I would choose my description of the UML diagram. I would seperate the different OOP principles to make the description easier to read.

5. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
   -I thought that The Gaming Room's needs were quite apparent. They needed a web-based game that would be compatible with many platforms and that could scale with growth. Considering the user's
    need is one of the most important part of software development. If the game is not user-friendly or appealing no one would play it.

6. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
   -I first took note of the client's requirements for their game. Then highlited the software needs to meet those requirements. Then refined it from a user's standpoint. In the future
    I will implement the same technique of separating these different elements and connecting them all together to create and analyze the software application.
